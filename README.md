# CinemaCommunity

Platform for movie lovers 

This project is designed to allow students to demonstrate knowledge and skills (HMTL, CSS, Bootstrap, Python and Django) acquired through out the interactive web dev course.

Project Description
This project is about an "imaginary" community of cinema lovers that gather together to organize a variety of movie-related events. The community website also has a blog where registered members would write different movie related articles or posts. Apart from the hero section the remaining sections of the website will be dynamic (content stored in the database). The project files include a mockup of the desired website design. (fonts and font sizes modified).
